# CSS-Concepts
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
This repository is where Iâ€™m keeping track of everything Iâ€™m learning about CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I'm exploring how to style websites, and this repo includes my practice files, and small experiments.

ðŸ“‚ What's Inside
Basics â€“ Selectors, properties, colors, text styles

Box Model â€“ Margin, padding, border, content

Layouts â€“ Flexbox, Grid, positioning

Responsive Design â€“ Media queries and mobile-friendly tips

Animations & Transitions â€“ Basic effects

Mini Projects â€“ Small challenges to practice concepts

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Made This
I created this repo to:

Keep everything I learn in one place

Practice using GitHub while learning CSS

Share what I'm learning in case it helps someone else too
